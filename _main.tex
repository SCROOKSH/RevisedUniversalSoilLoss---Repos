\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Motivation}

Modelling soil erosion in post-burn areas is critical for understanding how broad-scale change impacts soil properties and structures. The RUSLE, the most commonly used soil erosion model, has primarily been applied to model soil erosion in agricultural regions. Applying the RUSLE in non-agriculture regions presents a substantial challenge. This challenge is driven by data availability and the applicability of RUSLE factors for non-uniform slopes and cover classes. As a result, RUSLE outcome values for non-linear, semi-natural, or steep regions must be considered the spatial representation of trends in soil erosion. In this report, we demonstrate the application of the RUSLE for modelling soil erosion across two watersheds in the Kootenay region of British Columbia. The RUSLE soil erosion maps demonstrate the spatial variation of soil erosion across the study area and signify areas where soil erosion is predicted to be higher or lower.

\subsection*{Objective}\label{objective}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Objective}

This project aims to apply the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) for post-fire soil erosion modelling in a study area in the West Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia. The specific objectives of this work are to (i) collect and process soil erosion modelling data (rainfall, soil erodibility, slope length, crop cover, and management practices), (ii) apply the RUSLE across the study area, and (iii) simulate RUSLE modelling under variable fire extent conditions. This report intends to demonstrate the application of the RUSLE across a heterogeneous landscape and provide guidelines for future soil erosion modelling.

\subsection*{Background}\label{background}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Background}

Soil erosion involves multiple processes which collectively impact the transportation of particles across landscapes. Assessing and mitigating soil erosion and land degradation is critical due to the possible effects of these processes, which include nutrient loss, river and reservoir siltation, water quality degradation, and decreases in soil productivity (\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257785877_Estimation_of_soil_losses_by_USLE_model_using_GIS_at_Mashhad_plain_Northeast_of_Iran}{Bagherzadeh, 2014}). Across a landscape, erosion can result from flow, occur within channels of concentrated flow (rills and gullies), and occur through raindrop impact and overland flow (\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223520981_A_review_of_hillslope_and_watershed_scale_erosion_and_sediment_transport_models}{Aksoy and Kavvas, 2005}).

Wildfires are identified as one of the main drivers of soil erosion and land degradation (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825205001467}{Shakesby and Doerr, 2006}). One direct effect of wildfires is the loss of protective cover, which reduces rainfall interception, surface roughness, evapotranspiration, and the infiltration capacity of soils. Soil structure can be altered directly in moderate to high-severity wildfires due to the destruction of the organic or mineralogical bindings of soil particles (\href{https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2007.0432}{Larsen and MacDonald, 2007}; \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284913901_Modelling_the_Effect_of_Soil_Burn_Severity_on_Soil_Erosion_at_Hillslope_Scale_in_the_First_Year_Following_Wildfire_in_nw_Spain}{Fernández et al., 2010}). After fires, the fraction of bare soil exposed to raindrop impact is increased, allowing the kinetic energy of raindrops to be directly transferred to the soil surface, where to soil structure is degraded (\href{http://www.fsl.orst.edu/ltep/Biscuit/Biscuit_files/Refs/DeBano\%20JH2000b\%20fire.pdf}{DeBano et al., 1998}; \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222698132_Fire_Effects_on_Infiltration_Rates_After_Prescribed_Fire_in_Northern_Rocky_Mountain_Forests_USA}{Robichaud et al., 2000}). The destruction of soil structure, both directly and indirectly by fire, contributes to runoff and particle detachment, and increases sediment loss (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825205001467}{Shakesby and Doerr, 2006}). In some conditions, the removal of the surface cover, combined with fire-induced changes, leads to the creation of soil crusts, which inhibit infiltration (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857418304713}{Silva et al., 2019}).

Effective land management in post-fire regions can mitigate soil erosion and limit soil degradation; such efforts can be improved by understanding how erosion processes occur and what areas are vulnerable to soil loss. Methods for estimating the risk of soil erosion are essential for planning post-fire soil management measures (\href{https://www.jstor.org/stable/42952602}{Vega et al., 2013}). Advances in technology, such as the development of soil erosion models and increases in computing power for spatial analysis, have assisted in making soil erosion modelling faster and more accurate. The most widely used models to estimate post-fire soil erosion by water are empirically based. These include the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE; \href{https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/CAT79706928/PDF}{Wischmeier and Smith, 1978}) and its revised form RUSLE (\href{https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/64080530/RUSLE/AH_703.pdf}{Renard et al., 1997}). The wide application of the USLE and the RUSLE is related to the fact that empirical models require less input data than physically based ones (\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228552294_A_Review_of_Erosion_and_Sediment_Transport_Models}{Merrit et al., 2003}). The USLE and RUSLE models, were developed to estimate soil erosion by water in agricultural regions and are not commonly applied for erosion modeling across rugged or burned areas with heterogenous vegetation cover (\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270163637_Modeling_the_impacts_of_wildfire_on_runoff_and_pollutant_transport_from_coastal_watersheds_to_the_nearshore_environment}{Morrison and Kolden, 2015}; \href{https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/7/1995/htm}{Hosseini et al., 2018}) and soil properties (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666683921000365}{Chen et al., 2013}; \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307181869_Synthesis_of_soil-hydraulic_properties_and_infiltration_timescales_in_wildfire-affected_soils_Synthesis_of_soil-hydraulic_properties_in_wildfire-affected_soils}{Moody et al., 2013}; \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935117317644}{Fernández and Vega, 2018}; \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706119329052}{Nunes et al., 2020}).

Post-fire soil erosion modelling can provide accurate predictions of the hydrological and geomorphological effects of fires across variable landscapes. However, building a input data database is difficult, not only because of regional differences in climate, soil properties, and fire characteristics but also due to differences in research approaches and scales (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825205001467}{Shakesby and Doerr, 2006}), or due to the model limitations in representing soil erosion processes (\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222472796_Why_Soil_Erosion_Models_Over-Predict_Small_Soil_Losses_and_Under-Predict_Large_Soil_Losses}{Nearing, 1998}).The need to adapt models to post-fire conditions and validate their predictions has been emphasized in several studies (\href{https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2007.0432}{Larsen and MacDonald, 2007}; \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935117317644}{Fernández and Vega, 2018}; \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825221001112}{Girona-García et al.,2021}), and identified as equally important to developing a new model specifically for post-fire conditions.

The integration of existing soil erosion models, field data, and data provided by remote sensing technologies through the use of geographic information systems (GIS) is an asset to post-fire soil erosion studies (\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242519680_Multi-temporal_soil_erosion_risk_assessment_in_N_Chalkidiki_using_a_modified_USLE_raster_model}{Gitas et al., 2009}). Remote sensing, which enables the modelling of long- and short-term variation in soil erosion, is a valuable tool for quantifying spatial patterns of soil erosion and land degradation over time (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987115001255\#!}{Ganasri et al., 2016}). The increased availability of remote sensing data (\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/513030a}{Wulder \& Coops, 2014}) and ongoing computational advancements (\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312518132_Satellite_detection_of_rising_maize_yield_heterogeneity_in_the_US_Midwest}{Azzari \& Lobell, 2017}) have facilitated broad-scale soil erosion research (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479721018740}{North et al., 2022}, \href{https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09715010.2020.1814881}{Prasad et al., 2022}). Developing semi-automated soil erosion modelling methods using common coding languages, such as R, and GIS programs, such as ArcGIS, facilitate the development of consistent, and comparable modelling methods.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsection*{Limitations}\label{limitations}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Limitations}

Despite the many strengths of the RUSLE, it has limitations such that it does not capture gullying and/or shallow landslides, is not process-based, does not capture feedbacks between model components, nor does it estimate delivery/deposition of eroded sediments. Being an empirical model developed in North America for agriculture, RUSLE applications should be validated and/or calibrated when estimating surface erosion. Previous reviews have covered these limitations in detail (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095633919300048}{Alewell et al., 2019}) and further demonstrated that RUSLE outputs have similar ranges of uncertainty when compared with more complex process-based physical models such as WEPP and PESERA. In most cases, there remain large uncertainties associated with the predictions made by models (\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334496630_On_the_evaluation_of_soil_erosion_models_Are_we_doing_enough}{Batista et al.~2019}; \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X20302725}{Baartman et al.~2020}), particularly for those concerned with routing sediment through large and/or complex watersheds.

The RUSLE erodibility factor (K) has been the main target of criticism from several researchers. \href{https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2007.0432}{Larsen and MacDonald (2007)} and \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222540666_Modeling_soil_erosion_on_steep_sagebrush_rangeland_before_and_after_prescribed_fire}{Moffet et al.~(2007)} suggested that the current algorithms for calculating soil erodibility are not consistent with the understanding of post-fire erosion processes. Fernández and Vega (2018) also concluded that the erodibility in the RUSLE equation does not reflect fire-induced changes in soil properties because it does not consider the influence of burn severity; while others state that the K factor does not reflect the changes in soil permeability and structure after wildfire (\href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.13543}{Moody et al., 2013}; \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270163637_Modeling_the_impacts_of_wildfire_on_runoff_and_pollutant_transport_from_coastal_watersheds_to_the_nearshore_environment}{Morrison and Kolden, 2015}). \href{https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2007.0432}{Larsen and MacDonald (2007)} and \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222540666_Modeling_soil_erosion_on_steep_sagebrush_rangeland_before_and_after_prescribed_fire}{Moffet et al.~(2007)}) also suggested that, to achieve greater precision, the K factor should be reformulated and \href{https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2007.0432}{Larsen and MacDonald (2007)} also suggested that soil moisture would be more properly included in the K factor, followed by an adaptation to site-specific conditions.

Several authors adapted the rainfall erosivity to local climates. However, this raised criticism of the application of the RUSLE model in recently burned areas. For example, \href{https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2007.0432}{Larsen and MacDonald (2007)} suggested that the R calculated according to \href{https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/CAT79706928/PDF}{Wischmeier and Smith, 1978} equation would overestimate predictions due to the assumed linearity between the rainfall erosivity and sediment yields. In contrast, the same authors also suggested that if the rainfall erosivity factor is adapted to different climates, it may lead to a lower final value for the predicted soil erosion by water, with inherent implications for model performance. This study aims to produce an overview of soil erosion in the study area, which reflect the general erosion rates rather than specific per ha values. Our approach reflects the limitations of the RUSLE for post-burn areas. \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935117317644}{Fernández and Vega, (2018)} also concluded that the soil erodibility (K) in the RUSLE equation does not reflect fire-induced changes in soil properties because it does not consider the influence of burn severity; while others state that the K factor does not reflect the changes in soil permeability and structure after fire (\href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.13543}{Moody et al., 2013}; \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270163637_Modeling_the_impacts_of_wildfire_on_runoff_and_pollutant_transport_from_coastal_watersheds_to_the_nearshore_environment}{Morrison and Kolden, 2015}).

\section*{RUSLE Factors}\label{factors}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{RUSLE Factors}

The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is a modified version of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) proposed by \href{https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/CAT79706928/PDF}{Wischmeier and Smith, 1978}, which was developed for predicting annual soil loss across agriculture regions. In this study, the RUSLE is used to estimate soil loss during the first year after fire (Trozzo Creek Fire (2021)).

The RUSLE equation is comprised of five factors which are multiplied to produce a RUSLE soil erosion surface.

\begin{equation}
A = R * LS * K * C * P
\end{equation}

Where \textbf{R} is the rainfall erosivity, \textbf{LS} is a non-dimensional topographic factor, \textbf{K} is the soil erodibility, \textbf{C} is a cover-management factor, and \textbf{P} reflects soil conservation practices.

\hypertarget{sec-factor-1}{%
\subsection*{Factor 1 - Rainfall Erosivity (R)}\label{sec-factor-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Factor 1 - Rainfall Erosivity (R)}

R is the rainfall and runoff factor by geographic location. The greater the intensity and duration of the rain storm, the higher the erosion potential.

Among the factors included in RUSLE, rainfall erosivity is often most closely correlated with temporal trends in soil loss (\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336586973_A_comprehensive_study_of_erosivity_and_soil_erosion_over_a_small_tropical_islet_Round_Island_Mauritius}{Hedding et al.,2020}), since sediments are rarely detached without sufficient rainfall. The impact of rainfall's kinetic energy on soil erosion is captured in the R factor. We use global rainfall erosivity data combined and provided by the \href{https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/global-rainfall-erosivity\#tabs-0-description=1}{European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC)}. The data used in this study is the most accurate and currently available in the study region. However, the spatial scale of this data is a limitation and prevents high-resolution RUSLE outputs from being derived.

\hypertarget{sec-factor-2}{%
\subsection*{Factor 2 - Slope Length (LS)}\label{sec-factor-2}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Factor 2 - Slope Length (LS)}

LS is the slope length-gradient factor. The LS factor represents a ratio of soil loss under given conditions to that at a site. The steeper and longer the slope, the higher the risk for erosion.

The LS factor is one of the most challenging factors of the RUSLE. The L and S factors are combined as the topographic LS factor. Slope steepness (S) seeks to capture the rate of change in soil loss with varying gradients, while slope length (L) accounts for the distance over which a slope gradient occurs. Estimates of S and L for British Columbia are improved via enhanced hydrological flow routing and empirical equations describing S and L (see \textbf{Table 1}). Here, the LS-calculation is performed using the original equation proposed by Desmet and Govers (1996).

\textbf{Table 1.} Values for topographic factor, LS, for low ratio of rill:inter-rill erosion, such as consolidated soil conditions with cover and rangeland (applicable to thawing soils where both inter-rill and rill erosion are significant) (\href{https://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/manuals/2002-92/rusle-can.pdf}{Wall et al., 2002}).

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Factor 3 - Soil Erodibility (K)}

K is the soil erodibility factor. It is the average soil loss in tonnes/hectare (tons/acre) for a particular soil. K is a measure of the susceptibility of soil particles to detachment and transport by rainfall and runoff.

The K factor incorporates the physical and chemical properties of soil, including fractions of sand, silt, and clay, permeability, structural stability, and organic matter content. The K factor ranges from 1 (very easily eroded) to 0.01 (very stable soil). K factors have been estimated for several surface textures (\textbf{Table 2}). We combined soil texture data for the study region with previously calculated soil erodibility data for the province of British Columbia. Without field data, K value information is limited, hence our use of \href{https://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/manuals/2002-92/rusle-can.pdf}{province-wide} soil erodibility assessments.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Factor 4 - Crop/Vegetation and Management Factor (C)}

C is the crop/vegetation and management factor. It is used to determine the relative effectiveness of soil and crop management systems in terms of preventing soil loss.

In Canada, C factor values have been developed for major agricultural regions where heavy cropping, tillage, and soil management systems of Canadian crops have been developed. Formulations of the C factor generally only include three cover scenarios (i.e., bare ground, grass, and tree cover) that remain static throughout the year (\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2867509/}{Dymond et al., 2010}). The majority of the study area is covered in forested and semi-natural land. Here, C factor values are assigned based on those proposed by (\href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235988636_Application_of_the_revised_universal_soil_loss_equation_model_on_landslide_prevention_An_example_from_N_Euboea_Evia_Island_Greece}{Rozos et al.~2013)} (\textbf{Table 3}).

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Factor 5 - The Support Practice Factor (P)}

P is the support practice factor. It reflects the effects of practices that will reduce the amount and rate of the water runoff and thus reduce the amount of erosion.

The Support Practice factor (P) accounts for the erosion control effectiveness of support practices. The most commonly used supporting cropland practice are cross slope cultivation, contour farming, strip cropping, and terracing. Common P values are presented in \textbf{Table 4.} In the absence of any support practice, P assumes unity and equals 1 in the RUSLE. Here we use a P value of 1 to reflect that support practices have not been completed in the area.

This application of the RUSLE uses data for the Trozzo and Winlaw Creek watersheds which are located in the West Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia (\textbf{Figure 1}).

The provided R-factor map at resolutions of 30 arc-sec (\textasciitilde1 km at the Equator). This data offers complete global rainfall erosivity data based on 3625 precipitation stations and around 60,000 years of rainfall records at high temporal resolution (1 to 60 minutes). Rainfall erosivity values (MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1) for the study area range between 483.7963 and 622.4443 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1. These values are consistent with those reported for British Columbia. For example, according to a report by \href{https://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/manuals/2002-92/rusle-can.pdf}{Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada}, R values in Vancouver, B.C. are approximately 378 MJ mm ha-1 h-1. Marginally lower R values in the study area are explained by the geographic location of the study area, being inland from the west coast temperate zone.

These K estimations are based on the information obtained on approximately 1600 samples collected in Southern Ontario by Ontario Institute of Pedology surveyors. Values used here follow the recommendation by \href{https://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/manuals/2002-92/rusle-can.pdf}{Wall et al., 2002} (\textbf{Figure 15}). They suggest that if the organic matter content of a soil is unknown and cannot be obtained through extensive soil testing fieldwork, `average K' values should be used for RUSLE modelling.
